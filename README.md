# **       College uniform classification system       **


 
## **Description**

College uniform classification system is a deep learning-based image classification system that identifies whether a person in an image is wearing a uniform or not. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and includes data augmentation to improve accuracy, even with a small dataset.

## **Key Features**

1. **Binary Image Classification**:  
   - Classifies images into two categories:  
     - **Person Wearing Uniform**  
     - **Person Not Wearing Uniform**  

2. **Custom Dataset Creation**:  
   - Collected data using Python web scraping.  
   - Prepared a custom dataset specifically for this task.

3. **Data Augmentation**:  
   - Enhances model performance by generating diverse training samples through techniques like flipping, rotation, zooming, etc.

4. **Transfer Learning**:  
   - Leveraged the **VGG16** pre-trained model to improve accuracy and efficiency.  
   - VGG16 is particularly effective at capturing colors and textures in images, which is crucial for this project.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**:  
   - Provides a clear and simple interface for easy interaction.

6. **Flexible Input Options**:  
   - Users can classify images by:  
     - Uploading images from their computer.  
     - Using a live feed from their web camera.
